**Answer**:

- PeacoQC: Peak-based detection of high quality cytometry data.
- PeacoQCHeatmap: Make overview heatmap of quality control analysis.
- PlotPeacoQC: Visualise deleted cells of PeacoQC.
- RemoveDoublets: Remove doublet events from flow cytometry data.
- RemoveMargins: Remove margin events of flow cytometry data.

# Problem 2

*Take a closer look at the list of Bioconductor cytometry packages. Report back on how many there are currently in Bioconductor, the author/maintainer with the most contributed cytometry R packages, and a couple packages that you would be interested in exploring more in-depth later in the course.*
